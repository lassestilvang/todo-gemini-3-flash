# Product Guidelines\n\n## Tone of Voice\n- **User-Configurable:** The application allows users to select their preferred communication style in settings, supporting:\n    - **Professional & Concise:** Direct, objective, and efficient.\n    - **Friendly & Encouraging:** Warm, supportive, and human.\n    - **Technical & Precise:** Standard industry terminology.\n\n## Error Handling & Empty States\n- **Action-Oriented:** Every error message and empty state must provide a clear, actionable next step (e.g., "No tasks found. [Create New Task]"). Avoid dead ends.\n\n## Accessibility\n- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:** The application must adhere to standard requirements for color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support to ensure inclusivity.\n\n## Data Density & Layout\n- **User-Controlled Density:** Provide an explicit toggle for users to switch between "Comfortable" (more whitespace) and "Compact" (higher information density) views, independent of the device.\n\n## Onboarding\n- **Empty State Onboarding:** Utilize the initial empty states of main views (Inbox, Today, etc.) to subtly guide users on how to add content and use the features, avoiding heavy-handed tutorials.
